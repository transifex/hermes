Python hermes-py Documentation
==============================
Hermes is a Postgres-talking, event-driven, failure-handling Python library.
Its main purpose is to enable the easy implementation of resilient Python
processes which require communication with Postgres. It defines a base-layer
which you can build as little or as much as you like on top of.

It's been used at Transifex to fulfil a number of roles, one of them
including a Postgres -> Elasticsearch river.

Compatibility
-------------
*nix operating system which supports the select function.

Postgresql 9.0+ is required to support `LISTEN/NOTIFY <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html>`_ commands.

Installation
------------
::

    pip install hermes-pg

Usage
-----
Most users will just need to define some form of process to run when an event
is emitted. This can be achieved by defining a processor object and supplying
that to the Client object like so::

    from hermes.components import Component

    class Processor(Component):
        def execute(self):
            pass

        def execution
